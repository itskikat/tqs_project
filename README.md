## Project Abstract

### Title: **WeDo4U**

### Description:

This project has the objective to implement a *multi-layered, enterprise web application with a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) strategy*, applied throughout the software engineering process.

It incorporates a **digital marketplace** to *offer on-demand household services (plumber, cleaner, furniture assembly, handyman, etc.)*, with the nearest independent service professionals.

The platform manages a dynamic workforce of service professionals; accepts orders; optimizes the assignment of jobs to the professionals; and allows scheduled visits. It will have separated areas for the professionals to input the services provided and times, and for the consumers to use the platform and order or schedule a service.

It will includes **two main “sub-projects”**:
- The **deliveries platform (“engine”)**, with use cases such as riders’ registration and reputation management, dynamic matchmaking of orders and riders, performance dashboard, etc.
- A **specific application/market proposition** that leverages on the deliveries platform, e.g., food ordering, drugs (medicines) delivery, “small” marketplace promoted by a municipality to stimulate local stores, etc.
